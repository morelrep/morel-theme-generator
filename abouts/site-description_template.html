<p>MOREL is a scalable platform. And as the amount of metadata being stored grows, and new functionalities are developed, it will allow to know relevant data about this literary corpus.</p>

<p>In this first stage, the archive has been partially fed by the compilations of Mark Sanders, Paulette Ramsay, Antonio D Tillis, Keenan Norris, Idelfonso Pereda Vald√©s and Emilio Vallagas. But the archive is open for users and beneficiaries of the platform to <a href="/morel-theme-generator/add">add new content</a>.</p>

<p>If you have a work or translation in mind that is not part of this archive, please <a href="/morel-theme-generator/add">suggest its incorporation</a>!</p>

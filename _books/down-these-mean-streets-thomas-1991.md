I want to write that despite their burdens they are working with the white man toward a productive relationship.”</p> <p>I glanced at Brew. He was studying the shadows on the walls. I took a good look at the Pennsylvanian. He was tan-colored and not really very negroid-looking. I got a funny, almost proud feeling that I looked more negroid than he did.</p> </div>

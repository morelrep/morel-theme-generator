There she was, not in the city but in the deep jungle, writing and gleaming at the center of a group of naked Negroes. She was dancing to the beat of the deep drums, whose music took on Beethoven’s rich harmony and yet retained all their telluric vigor. I knew that this was a strange and absurd synthesis, and yet in my dream I heard it happen. It was like a monstrous hybrid--of a dolphin or an albatross and a panther, say. It was so powerful that I was swept up in a kind of whirlwind, and I twisted and vibrated like a bow when its strings snaps. This was the goal toward which the uncontrollable, fiery cataract of my life was rushing. The dream reoccurred many times; it was the work of a clever succubus who came to my cot regularly to conduct her oneiric concert.</p> </div>

<div data-schema-version="8"><p>Behold, yon placid, plodding, staid old man,</p> <p>His still and solemn features closely scan!</p> <p>In his calm look how wisdom's light is shed,</p> <p>How the grey hairs, become his honoured head!</p> <p>Mark how the merchants bow, as he goes by,</p> <p>How men on 'Change, at his approach draw nigh,</p> <p>“Highly respected," and esteemed ; 'tis said,</p> <p>His fame to Afric's farthest shore is spread!</p> <p>Behold, his house!—if marble speak elsewhere,</p> <p>“Sermons in stones" are with a vengeance here,</p> <p>Whate'er the potent will of wealth can do</p> <p>Or pride can wish, is offered to your view.</p> <p>Those gay saloons, this banquet hall's array,</p> <p>This glaring pile in all its pomp survey,</p> <p>The grandeur strikes—one must not look for taste—</p> <p>What's gorgeous, cannot always be quite chaste.</p> </div>

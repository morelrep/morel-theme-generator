{{ site.title}} is a resource for readers, writers, publishers, students and teachers interested in Afro-American and Latin American culture in general, and Afro-Latin American culture in particular. It gathers book covers, excerpts, bibliographic clues and digital downloads of works by black Latin American authors in original language and in translation.

Works are organized by dynamic lists, which automatically group the works according to common characteristics:

- [authors]({{site.BASE_PATH}}/criteria/author)
- [city of publication]({{site.BASE_PATH}}/criteria/city)
- [imprint or publisher]({{site.BASE_PATH}}/criteria/publisher)
- [nationality of authors]({{site.BASE_PATH}}/criteria/nationality)
- [edition date]({{site.BASE_PATH}}/criteria/edition)
- [digital repository]({{site.BASE_PATH}}/criteria/repository).

{{ site.title }} has  also a [search engine]({{site.BASE_PATH}}/search) that allows you to find works directly.

Today there are approximately {{ site.books.size }} books available on {{ site.title }}, organized by {{ site.authors.size }} authors, {{ site.publishers.size }} presses and publishers, and {{ site.repositories.size }} repositories.

{{ site.title }} is a scalable platform. And as the amount of metadata being stored grows, and new functionalities are developed, it will allow to know relevant data about this literary corpus.

In this first stage, the archive has been partially fed by the compilations of Mark Sanders, Paulette Ramsay, Antonio D Tillis, Keenan Norris, Idelfonso Pereda Valdés and Emilio Vallagas. But the archive is open for users and beneficiaries of the platform to [add new content]({{site.BASE_PATH}}/add). 

If you have a work or translation in mind that is not part of this archive, please [suggest its incorporation]({{site.BASE_PATH}}/add)!

<p>The collection is organized by dynamic lists, which group the works according to common characteristics (<a href="/morel-theme-generator/criteria/author">authors</a>, <a href="/morel-theme-generator/criteria/city">city of publication</a>, <a href="/morel-theme-generator/criteria/publisher">imprint or publisher</a>, <a href="/morel-theme-generator/criteria/nationality">nationality of authors</a>, <a href="/morel-theme-generator/criteria/edition">edition date</a> and <a href="/morel-theme-generator/criteria/repository">digital repository</a>). But it also has a <a href="/morel-theme-generator/search">search engine</a> that allows you to find works directly.</p>

<p>Today there are approximately 0 books available on MOREL, organized by 0 authors, 0 presses and publishers, and 0 repositories. In addition, 31 more works are in progress.</p>

<p>MOREL is a scalable platform. And as the amount of metadata being stored grows, and new functionalities are developed, it will allow to know relevant data about this literary corpus.</p>

<p>In this first stage, the archive has been partially fed by the compilations of Mark Sanders, Paulette Ramsay, Antonio D Tillis, Keenan Norris, Idelfonso Pereda Vald√©s and Emilio Vallagas. But the archive is open for users and beneficiaries of the platform to <a href="/morel-theme-generator/add">add new content</a>.</p>

<p>If you have a work or translation in mind that is not part of this archive, please <a href="/morel-theme-generator/add">suggest its incorporation</a>!</p>

It was so powerful that I was swept up in a kind of whirlwind, and I twisted and vibrated like a bow when its strings snaps. This was the goal toward which the uncontrollable, fiery cataract of my life was rushing. The dream reoccurred many times; it was the work of a clever succubus who came to my cot regularly to conduct her oneiric concert.</p> </div>

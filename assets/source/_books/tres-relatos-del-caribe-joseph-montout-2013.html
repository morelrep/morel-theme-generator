<div data-schema-version="8"><p>Jenny Wilkins boarded the bus at the first stop of Corales No. 1, Jenny Wilkings, a very loquacious old soul, very positive in her remarks, loud, very loud in speaking. Her head tied with a bright red hand-kerchief, as a neighbor a virago, always ready to voice her opinion, with interjections of strong adjectives.</p> <p>“Wat guine an Miss Manda”. She greeted Amanda, her friend.</p> <p>“Nat a ting. Guaing to town fi see wat me can by. Nat a ting in dese dam shaps in Corales”.</p> <p>“Youh no knaw.
